# **Homework 01 – Docker and SQL**

## **Question 1: Understanding Docker Images**

---

### Objective
Run a Docker container using the `python:3.13` image, enter it with a Bash shell, and identify the installed `pip` version.

See `docker-compose.yaml` file.

### Steps

- Verify Docker is running
```bash
docker --version
```

- Pull the python image
```bash
docker pull python:3.13
```

- Run the container with Bash as entrypoint
```bash
docker run -it --entrypoint bash python:3.13
```

- Check the pip version
```bash
pip --version
```

- Exit the container
```bash
exit
```

### pip version is `pip 25.3`

## **Question 2: Understanding Docker Networking and docker-compose**

### Objective

Identify the hostname and port that pgAdmin should use to connect to the PostgreSQL database defined in the provided docker-compose.yaml.

### Key points

- Both services are defined in the same docker-compose file
- Docker Compose creates a shared network for services
- Services can reach each other using the service name as the hostname
- The internal container port must be used (not the host-mapped port)

### Correct connection details for pgAdmin
```bash
Hostname: db
Port: 5432
```
