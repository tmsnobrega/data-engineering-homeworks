# **Homework 01 – Docker and SQL**

## **Question 2: Understanding Docker Networking and docker-compose**

### Objective

Identify the hostname and port that pgAdmin should use to connect to the PostgreSQL database defined in the provided docker-compose.yaml.

### Key points

- Both services are defined in the same docker-compose file
- Docker Compose creates a shared network for services
- Services can reach each other using the service name as the hostname
- The internal container port must be used (not the host-mapped port)

### Correct connection details for pgAdmin
```bash
Hostname: db
Port: 5432
```
